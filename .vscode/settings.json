/* 
A settings.json file for VSCode reproducing some PyCharm defaults I like:

   * Automatially add the "Project Root" (aka Workspace Folder) to the PYTHONPATH
   * Execute scripts in the folder where the script is
   * Run scripts in an interactive console (either python or ipython)

If you are used to PyCharm (or a scientific programming language like MATLAB), you are also probably going to like these settings.

To apply the settings to a specific project, save this file in the .vscode folder in the Project Root.
To apply them globally, use it in your user settings file, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings 
for further details.
